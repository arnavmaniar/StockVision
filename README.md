# Hi! Thanks for checking out StockVision


This project is still currently a work in progress. Currently, the ML models are all functional, however I am still running into issues with accuracy. I have attributed this primarily to data availability:
- Share prices fluctuate based on sentiment, and that data is often locked behind a paywall. With that information, I hope to add more accuracy to the model.
- Streamlit is currently working on localhost but deployment is not functional. Hoping to fix soon at stockvision.streamlit.app

Unfortunately, my development on this project has been slowed due to college application season. Hoping to start dev'ing again during ~~November~~ December/Winter Break.
